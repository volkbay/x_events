# The X Library

Generic C++ library for vision-based navigation, with multi-sensor fusion capabilities for thermal, range, solar and GPS measurements.

See the [xWiki](https://github.com/jpl-x/x/wiki) for more information about [x](https://github.com/jpl-x/x/wiki/the-x-Library).

>**Note**
> This particular X Library (for event-based vision) uses [Haste Library](https://github.com/ialzugaray/haste), so Eigen3 version should be >= v3.4.
